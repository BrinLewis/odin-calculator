# odin-calculator

This project is the final project at the end of The Odin Project's foundation course. I will utilise all of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills I have garnered throughout the course to produce an on-screen calculator that can perform simple operations such as add, subtract, multiply and divide. The calculator will also look good asthetically and have a fully functional straightfoward display.
